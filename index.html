                    <p>
                        I distinctly recall receiving the first message from Vickie almost two years ago. We were both trying to meet people, looking for that special someone online. She sent me a message saying just a little bit about herself, and asking me for my thoughts on world travel. It was cute and just a little bit silly – two traits I’ve come to very much love about her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	                   Apparently I answered correctly regarding my desire to see Paris and Venice, because about a week (and many messages) later we met at Bravo! Cucina Italiana in Whitehall. I was definitely excited going into the date; while I previously had very mixed results with such online ventures, everything about Vickie seemed perfect -- as she is, by the way. Every conversation with her was fun. Before we even met in person we had already invented the word “capron” (an apron you wear backward like a cape, obviously).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The night we met came about fairly quickly. While I can’t speak for Vickie, I have to admit that I had a fantastic time (and not just because of the amazing gnocchi). We talked for a couple of hours about our interests, our passions, and a number of decidedly-goofier topics. Lines were definitely drawn regarding turn-of-the-century pop music, but despite this “tension” it was a great night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think we both left that night hoping we’d be seeing each other again, and luckily we did! It was a hectic time of year (I was working in retail at the time, and the holidays were rapidly approaching), but we managed to see each other again about two weeks later (at which point we discovered that she was a significantly better bowler than me). By the end of that night we shared our first kiss together. Everything after that was history; I fell in love with the girl of my dreams, a year later I gave her a ring, and, most excitingly, she said “Yes!”

                    <p>
                        Little did I know that one day in mid-November 2013 during a search on OKCupid, I would stumble upon a guy whose eyes pierced my soul.  After reading through his profile, I knew I had to break the ice.  Rather than just opening with the overly used “Hey, what’s up?” (which in my experience, NEVER leads to a meaningful conversation with a stranger), instead I asked “If you could go anywhere in the world, where would it be?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We bonded over our shared desire to visit both Paris and Venice before then delving deeper.  I remember everyday coming home from work and excitedly checking email because Connor made me laugh and feel great.  I knew that I had to meet him in person since he seemed too good to be true!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We settled on meeting at Bravo! at the Lehigh Valley Mall in late November 2013.  I felt a connection with him as soon as he walked in the door.  So much so, that I hugged him.  I realized during the hug that while I might be comfortable hugging people, I had NO IDEA if he was!  After feeling like I had made things awkward within the first two minutes of the date, (he swears to this day he thought it was cute), we ate dinner talked about everything!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Time literally flew and before we knew it, it had been three hours.  We walked to our cars and we had our first disagreement on the best boy band of the 90s.  He thinks it was N*SYNC.  I know it was The Backstreet Boys.  ;)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I remember coming home after the date and wanting to send him an email expressing how much fun I had with him.  But I decided to wait for him to contact me (since that’s what every romantic comedy of the 80s, 90s, and 00s told me to do).  Fast forwardg a few days to Thanksgiving, and Connor was working at Target for Black Friday.  I decided to text him as much as possible to cheer him up since he was working on a major holiday.  Apparently, that made an impression and he asked me on a second date.  We went out for pizza and bowling (where I unabashedly beat him) before sharing in our first kiss together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short, I found the man of my dreams, fell in love, he asked me to marry him, and I am so THRILLED to be spending the rest of my life with him!

                        Ring shopping is hard. No, seriously; it’s terrifying. I had no difficulty deciding I wanted to marry Vickie. That was a no-brainer. But trying to find a ring unique and beautiful enough to remind her every day of my love for here? That seemed like an impossible task. Were it not for my (intrepid) mother accompanying me on a massive jewelry-store excursion, I may have failed miserably. To this day I can’t hear any homonym of the word “carrot” without breaking out in a cold-sweat… but that may just be my propensity for the melodramatic.

	It proved musch easier deciding how to propose. December 26th of the previous year I asked Vickie to be my girlfriend on the Sky Ride at Hershey Park. I thought it would be cute to ask her to be my wife at the same place. Months were spent plotting with her parents and our mutual friends about how to get her in the right place at the right time. Vickie believed she was going to her aunt’s house to help decorate for Christmas on Saturday, November 22nd. It wasn’t until the day before that I told her I'd be surprising her with a trip for the anniversary of our first date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
I would pick her up in the morning without telling her where we were going. We’d stop for lunch, spend the day in Hershey again, and meet our friends there in the evening as a surprise. This whole time I’d be nervously waiting to give the ring in my coat pocket. Correction: the ring in a massive protective box in my coat pocket. You truly wouldn’t believe how large the box was. I’d seen enough movie proposals to expect something small and discreet. Nope. This was a large plastic container substantial enough to serve as the cornerstone of a reasonably-sized building, and it was “buried” in my vest pocket under two layers of outerwear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
	I felt certain she would eventually notice the bulge sticking out the left side of my abdomen. I figured she’d realize that I was only hugging her with one arm all day (for fear of stabbing the woman I love with a paradoxical jewelery box that somehow managed to be both blunt and razor sharp at once). But she didn’t! By the end of that day my jacket was significantly less bulgy, and I was engaged to the woman I love.
